#Tuiter App

## Summary
                                 
I would like to implement the Bookmark feature, and administration tools. Users can bookmark or unbookmark a tuit, view all Tuits they have bookmarked, create, update and delete their account. Administrators can view, create, update, and delete user accounts. Therefore, I will implement different User roles which are general users and administrators. Both types of users need to create their account by selecting different roles. Different types of users will have different views and access when logged in. Users can only view their own profile page, but administrators have access to all user’s profile pages and would be able to modify user accounts.

## User stories

Story 1: As a User, I would like to create, update, and delete my account, so that I can manage
and update my account information.
- User must be able to log in and set a session
- User must be able to navigate to their settings page to update or delete their account
- User must be able to select if they are a general user (default) or an administrator when
creating their account

Story 2: As an administrator, I would like to create a User and view all existing Users in the application, so that I can help users create accounts and view users information for customer services.
- User must be able to log in and set a session
- Administrator must be able to navigate to an administrator page that shows all users
- Administrator must be able to search for another user based off of their username or email
Story 3: As an administrator, I would like to be able to update or delete user accounts, and delete Tuits, so that I can help users manage their account for customer services.
- User must be able to log in and set a session
- Administrator must to be able to navigate to general User’s profile page and update
user’s information or delete user account
Story 4: As a User, I would like to bookmark/unbookmark the Tuits, and view all the Tuits that I have bookmarked, so that I can save these tuits later for writing a clever response.
- User must be able to log in and set a session
- User must be able to bookmark and unbookmark Tuits
- Navigate to Bookmark screen to see bookmarked Tuits
